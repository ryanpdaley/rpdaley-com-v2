# rpdaley-com-v2

www.rpdaley.com - v2.0: randomly deployed to v2.rpdaley.com

As usual, I am using my own personal website to expand my experience with some technologies:

- React
- NextJS
- TailwindCss
- TypeScript

I am also using some git Actions / Automation / bots:

- CodeQL
- Dependabot
- Superlinter
- Auto-approve / Auto-merge dependabot PRs
  - This is not best practices, but I wanted to try it... there is nothing that gets deployed without me pushing it... :grimacing:
